## Before Deep Learning, Let's Machine Learning!

**Important to note:**

For both machine learning and deep learning, they are HIGHLY data-dependent! If your dataset is biased, the model will be biased! Hence, before constructing a model, the dataset has to be evaluated carefully to avoid any potential ethical issues and unforeseen outcomes.

In this tutorial, I will be using ```Scikit-Learn``` and this book: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow, to give an overview of how a machine learning model is built, specifically supervised learning. As the name suggested, supervised learning refers to the machine learning method which learns from labeled data.

There are four major components in most machine learning and deep learning system:

1.  Data Construction
2.  Feature Extraction
3.  Model Construction
4.  Model Evaluation
