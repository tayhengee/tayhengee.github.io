## Before Deep Learning, Let's Machine Learning!

**Important to note:**
For both machine learning and deep learning, they are HIGHLY data-dependent! IF your dataset is biased, the model will be biased! Hence, before constructing a model, datasset has to be evaluated carefully to avoid any potentail ethical issues and unforseen outcome.

There are four major components in most machine learning and deep learning system:

1.  Data Construction
2.  Feature Extraction
3.  Model Construction
4.  Model Evaluation
